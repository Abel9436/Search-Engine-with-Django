From high above, the bird saw everything.
The city below was bustling with activity.
Cars moved like ants on the streets.
People walked hurriedly, going about their day.
The bird enjoyed the view from its perch.
It felt free and unencumbered.
The wind ruffled its feathers gently.
It could see for miles and miles.
The horizon stretched endlessly.
Every day was a new scene to observe.
