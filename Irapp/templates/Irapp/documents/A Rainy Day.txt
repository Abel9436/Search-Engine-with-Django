The rain fell softly, drenching everything.
The streets were shiny and wet.
Puddles formed in every corner.
People hurried with umbrellas.
The sound of rain was soothing.
It was a perfect day for staying indoors.
The world outside seemed to slow down.
Raindrops tapped against the windows.
It was a day for hot tea and warm blankets.
A day to enjoy the peace and quiet.
