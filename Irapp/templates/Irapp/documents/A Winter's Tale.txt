Winter had arrived with its cold embrace.
Snow covered the ground like a blanket.
The trees were bare and silent.
The world seemed hushed and still.
Footprints marked paths in the snow.
The air was crisp and biting.
Inside, fires burned brightly in hearths.
People bundled up in warm clothing.
Winter was a time for stories and togetherness.
It was a season of quiet beauty.
